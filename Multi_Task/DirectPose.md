## DirectPose: Direct End-to-End Multi-Person Pose Estimation
The regression-based method have the potential to detect very dense keypoints.

The heatmap-based task is only used as an auxiliary loss during training.

**KPAlign**

Locator predict the rough locations of the keypoints from high-level features with a larger receptive field.

Sampler samples feature acorrding to the above offsets from high-resolution low-level features with a smaller receptive field.

Predictor make the final keypoint predictions.

**Heatmap Prediction**

Previous heatmap-based keypoint detection methods [1] generate unnormalized Gaussian distribution centered at each keypoint. we perform a per-pixel classification here for simplicity. Note that we make use of multiple binary classifiers (i.e., one-versus-all) and therefore the number of output channels is K instead of K + 1.

**GT of heatmap**

On the heatmaps, if a location is the nearest location to a keypoint with type t, the classification label for the location is set as t, 

where t âˆˆ {1, 2, ..., K}. Otherwise, the label is 0.
